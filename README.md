# EntityAntFarm

Simple entity component system based simulation of an ant farm. Project and design initially inspired by the wonderful talk given by Catherine West at RustCon 2018 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M). Uses the olcPixelGameEngine by JavidX9, the One Lone Coder. Also want to acknowledge the Bitsquid series on entity component systems, especially for getting the generational index working (http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2014/08/building-data-oriented-entity-system.html).
